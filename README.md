### Data Cleaning and Preparations

In the initial phase of the data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed on the different technologies used;

#### Excel
  1. Data loading and inspection
  2. Handling missing and null variables using ISBLANK function in Excel
  3. Eliminating duplicates.
  4. Data cleaning and formatting.

#### SQL
  1. Conversion of the already cleaned data from Excel to a CSV file format, this was to enable importation of the data into SQL quickly and efficiently as opposed to importing an Excel       file format directly.
  2. Creation of a database.

      ```SQL
          CREATE DATABASE LITA_PROJECT
      ```

     The above code creates a database that houses all tables ready for querying.
     
  4. Import the SalesData and CustomerData data into the already created database.
  5. Writing amazing codes to show the different trends and patterns in the dataset for making sound decisions (screenshot of the codes).

#### POWER BI
  1. launched the power bi environment.
  2. Importation of both datasets using the TEXT/CSV file extension.
  3. Explored and cleaned the dataset.
  4. Confirmed the integrity of the datasets by using column quality, column distribution, and column profile options under the view tab(screenshot of this).

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA involves exploring the data to answer some questions about the data such as;
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which products are top sellers
- What are the products on peak sales? (pivot tables and charts for both datasets here)

  Figure 3: Shows the already prepared dataset ready for visualizations. this is particularly important as it enables effective analysis of the data to make valid and informed decisions 
            that will in turn, identify patterns, and sales trends, as well as boost productivity. Hence, increasing revenue and customer satisfaction.
